# Blocitoff
**Blocitoff** is the first backend specialization that I chose for my Full Stack Web Development course at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io/). It is an application, built on Ruby on Rails, that allows users to keep their to-do lists manageable by creating self-destructing ones. If the to-do item is not important enough to be completed in seven days, it gets automatically deleted.

This app is deployed on Heroku:
The source code is here on Github: https://github.com/charryef/blocitoff
